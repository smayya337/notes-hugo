## Social Psychology and Science

**Confirmation bias** is searching for or processing information in ways consistent with pre-existing beliefs.

## Formulating Hypotheses and Theories

Psychology is a scientific endeavor! You have to generate theories and hypotheses, devise tests, analyze the results, and present what you learned. And then... that's right... you have to do it again.

## Research Designs

### The Observational Method

**Basic observation** is when you watch people do something and record what you observe.

**Archival analysis** is when you analyze existing records of behavior.

Some limits:

* Restricted to the observable
  * May be rare
  * May be subtle
* Doesn't say why something happened

### The Correlational Method

The **correlational method** involves statistically estimating the relationship between two variables. Note that correlation is not equal to causation! Also, you need to be careful about extraneous variables.

### The Experimental Method
