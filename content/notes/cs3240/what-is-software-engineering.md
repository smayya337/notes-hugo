Software engineering is more than just people who write code. It also includes:

* The upper management
* Project managers
* HR
* Artists/asset creators
* etc.

Software engineering is not the same as computer science. Computer science is a *science* -- it's a discipline focused around finding better ways to implement processes, such as finding a better way to implement an algorithm. Software engineering is focused around *building systems* that have practical use.

The term "software engineering" was first coined in 1968. Back then, programming was small in scale and usually used to solve complex or repetitive scientific problems. Nowadays, things are much different. You use software to acquire software. You often have to pay a subscription to use the software. Programs are far, far more powerful and far-reaching in scope.

It's important to remember that programming, while important, is actually a small part of software engineering. There's much more to it: How do you determine what your clients want? How do you share code with your teammates? How do you determine who has the rights to copy or use your code?
