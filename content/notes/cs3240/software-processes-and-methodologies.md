* Writing code is easy
* Engineering good software is hard
  * Humans are a big problem
    * Customers
    * Developers
    * Managers
  * Large software systems take on a life of their own
  * As soon as you introduce more than one person into the process, complications arise
* We need a well-defined, well-understood, repeatable software development process
* A **software process** is a set of activities that take place in sequence in the pursuit of creation of a software system
* "The creation and translation of human needs into requirements, requirements into design, design into code, testing, installing, etc."

## Software Process

* All processes have some form of:
  * Requirements elicitation
  * Requirements specification
  * Design
  * Development (design, implemented, verified)
  * Validation
  * Evolution (AKA maintenance)
* The form/iteration/timing/etc. of these activities defines different process families and methodologies

### Software Process Models

* Broadly speaking, process models and thus methodolodies fall on a continuum from **plan-driven** to **agile**
